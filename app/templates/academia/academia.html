                    <h2>Introduction and Historical Context</h2>
                    <p class="slim-margin">Our vision for the Digital Manufacturing Commons platform is to serve as the gateway to Digital Manufacturing and be a force for democratized access to best in breed tools and technologies. Our community is looking to us to provide
                        guidance and leadership in navigating the ever-evolving Digital Manufacturing landscape. We seek to highlight, showcase and expand the reach of innovative new approaches to learning, teaching and research that enable new forms
                        of collaboration and new solutions to be born from both novice and expert.</p>
                    <p class="slim-margin">Under the construct of DMDII projects we have been able to extend the DMC into the classroom and expose tomorrow's engineers to a new paradigm of digital work. Learners are exposed to the digital thread and how they can leverage our
                        platform to find, create and share solutions.</p>
                    <p class="slim-margin">In fulfilling our mission of sharing and collaboration, we endeavor to share these materials as a guide so that others may have an easier time learning and creating.</p>

                <h2>Syllabus Overview and Course Purpose:</h2>

                <p>Digital technologies influence every stage of product manufacturing, beginning from its conceptualization, to its manufacturing on a shop floor, its use by consumers and final disposal. Advances in computing, artificial intelligence,
                    automation and robotics and human-computer interaction have disrupted current manufacturing processes from the individual shop floor to the enterprise level. This digital connectivity between designers, production managers, supply
                    chain vendors and the physical industrial machines that produce the product will undoubtedly improve productivity. This course is first in a series of Smart Manufacturing based courses, which aims to introduce students on the power
                    of digital manufacturing and design technologies, particularly how product data can seamlessly transfer through the entire lifecycle of a manufactured product. All hands-on modeling and virtual manufacturing will be in Autodesk
                    Fusion 360, a cloud based design and manufacturing software. Students will be introduced to building apps that interact with 3D models and for process-monitoring applications. We will cover machine communication protocols in the
                    discrete manufacturing space, and how manufacturing data is used to improve shop-floor productivity.</p>
                <h2>Course Learning Objectives:</h2>
                <p>By the end of this course, the student will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Describe Product Model Information (PMI) and Model Based Definition of Discrete Products.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating Fusion 360 Apps to interact with 3D Models for Design and Manufacturing Workflows
                    </li>
