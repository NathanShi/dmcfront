While prior efforts have focused on optimizing the PBFAM process, this team will take a holistic look at optimizing a substantial subset of the manufacturing process chain. This includes the optimization of part geometry and material state through PBFAM, heat treatments and bulk machining. Analytical and process optimization tools will be developed including:\n\n1) model-based producibility tool for PBFAM and machining  \n2) PBFAM scan path optimization for high material integrity  \n3) prediction of thermal distortion  \n4) part compensation for distortion and machining  \n5) machining consideration and evaluation\n\nThe virtual tools will be integrated into the open-source platform, Digital Manufacturing Commons (DMC). This will allow the burgeoning AM industry to broadly adopt these modeling and simulation technologies, thus accelerating and standardizing their process certification methods. The project will also unlock tremendous value for small and medium size AM service providers and original equipment manufacturers to turn art-to-part in weeks instead of months with significant cost savings.\n\n**What is the industry problem this project addresses?**\n\n> Structured methods to mature and certify PBFAM are in their infancy meaning that numerous process iterations are required to achieve the requisite form and fit tolerances, surface finish, and material integrity. Thermal distortion, feature dependent surface roughness, shrinkage, cracking, and porosity are known artifacts in the PBFAM process.\n\n**If successful, what will the project provide or achieve?**\n\n> While prior efforts have solely focused on optimizing the PBFAM process, this team will take a holistic look at optimizing a substantial subset of the manufacturing process chain used to take a design from concept to the final part. It will be the first time to demonstrate an entire virtual workflow under an integrated system\n\n**What is the main deliverable of the project?**\n\n> Four digital models from pre-processing to final machining evaluation that will be integrated into DMC Optimized workflow of digital manufacturing of PBFAM process","principalPointOfContact":{"id":449,"displayName":"Scott Kruse","accountId":449,"profileId":449,"companyId":1,"companyName":"UI LABS","role":0,"realname":"Scott Kruse","title":null,"termsConditions":true,"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Kruse","email":"Scott.Kruse@uilabs.org","address":null,"phone":null,"image":null,"runningServices":{"items":[],"totalItems":0},"messages":{"items":[],"totalItems":0},"onboarding":{"id":449,"profile":false,"account":false,"company":false,"storefront":false},"skills":[],"roles":{"0":"SUPERADMIN","1":"MEMBER"},"isDMDIIMember":true,"userContactInfo":{"id":1117,"userPrivateContactInfo":null,"userPublicContactInfo":null,"userMemberPortalContactInfo":null},"aboutMe":null,"resume":"","account":0,"notifications":[],"hasUnreadNotifications":false,"timezone":null},"projectFocusArea":{"id":2,"name":"Manufacturing Processes"},"projectThrust":{"id":3,"name":"Advanced Analysis","code":"AA"},"contributingCompanyIds":[219,235,237],"rootNumber":15,"callNumber":7,"projectNumber":5,"costShare":806232.00,"dmdiiFunding":806232.00,"projectIdentifier":"15-7-5"},{"id":10,"primeOrganization":{"id":2,"name":"General Electric (GE)"},"principalInvestigator":{"id":14,"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Rangarajan","email":"Arvind.Rangarajan@ge.com"},"projectStatus":{"id":2,"name":"awarded"},"awardedDate":"2016-06-16","endDate":"2017-12-16","projectTitle":"Adaptive Machining Toolkit","projectSummary":"Geometric-adaptive machining technology allows machine tools or robots to accommodate and adjust to variations in workpiece geometry and/or position.
