One goal of the showcase is “getting people into the room to see if something new and better can be created as a result,” said Tom McDermott, Chief Program Officer of DMDII. Having access to nimble companies with innovative technology is attractive to DMDII partners looking to apply new tools to address manufacturing-related challenges.\n\nAt this Showcase, three project teams presented, as well as four startup organizations pitched their companies to the attendees.

However, high materials costs, a wide range of processing technologies and fragmented material databases have limited the growth of composites in industry. Similarly, while different elements of the software industry have developed powerful tools to provide critical design feedback for almost all aspects of design and manufacturing, very few of these toolsets work seamlessly together. Over the last two years, DARPA has undertaken an effort to integrate the design and analysis tool chain through its Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) suite of programs. Green Dynamics' recent DMDII grant award entitled _Structural Composites - Blade Multidisciplinary Design and Analysis (BladeMDA)_ seeks to capitalize on this effort by creating an integrated design and analysis software focused on the development of large composite structures, specifically wind turbine blades.\n\n**The primary goals of the completed software suite are:**\n\n*   Simplify the multidisciplinary design process by guiding designers through an incremental development approach across all product disciplines.\n*   Reduce the scope of disparate tool set expertise required to operate the range of key analysis codes used to analyze a complex turbine/rotor blade system.\n*   Close key gaps in the digital tool chain, particularly with respect to structural and manufacturing analysis and direct, fully integrated manufacturing plans and project costs.\n\nAt the completion of this project, we intend to demonstrate to the wind turbine composites industry a fully integrated digital design and analysis tool which covers concept development through work instruction and lamination file generation. A sub scale demonstration of a complete turbine blade will be created in order to validate manufacturing analysis tools and infusion flow properties. In addition we will provide training and educational courses for the software suite at relevant trade shows and to DMDII consortia members. Successful implementation of this software approach will reduce barriers to entry for smaller composite developers and shorten cycle times for current manufacturers all while providing a comprehensive cost and manufacturing model to prevent overruns.",

It will allow a designer to receive early feedback on problem areas of their design, with respect to a variety of manufacturing processes. The first prototype of this tool will consider machining, casting, die-casting and welding, but it will be expandable to other methods in the future. Similar to designers color-based finite element software they are used to, ANA will color 3D models of their part based on the analysis, showing them where their design is easy or difficult to produce.\n\n**What is the industry problem this project address?**\n\n> We lack a simple digital link to the novice designer during the conceptual design stage.\n\n**If successful, what will the project provide or achieve?**  \n\n> It will enable convergence to better designs fast and effectively, especially for the novice designer. Longer term, it will provide more robust designs that can migrate from process to process over their lifetime. In general, we expect ANA to lower cost, and shorter development time for new products.\n\n**What is the main deliverable of the project?**  \n\n> This project will deliver usable software in a Pre-Beta level of development.",

This technology seeks to replace the traditional design/manufacturing interaction, where the reliance on human-in-the-loop manufacturing engineering assessment results in long delays in product development and increased product costs. ARL Penn State will be the lead software developer for modifications to the iFAB tools as identified by the project team after evaluation of the current state software, as well as the development of the software interfaces to the Oshkosh-provided component library and PTC Windchill PLM system. ARL Penn State will support Oshkosh in completing the proposed iFAB Manufacturability Analysis System (MAS) use case and will concurrently develop a software specification to ensure successful implementation of the proposed technologies. Successful execution of the project will strengthen Oshkosh's commitment to full implementation at the completion of the effort. The developed technologies will be demonstrated to additional design and manufacturing organizations interested in future implementation of the iFAB MAS, particularly active members of DMDII. The System Specification Document deliverable will provide the necessary background for Oshkosh and other interested organizations to seamlessly implement the iFAB MAS without the need for additional research and development funding.\n\n**What is the industry problem this project address?**\n\n> Current ability to conduct detailed manufacturability assessments and cost roll-ups throughout the design process requires human-in-the-loop interaction.\n\n**If successful, what will the project provide or achieve?**\n\n> Reduced product development time (DARPA AVM goal) through lower manual effort in manufacturing data specification and developing product cost roll-ups. Reduced Engineering Change Requests (ECRs) by lowering the risk of non-manufacturable or costly designs being released to production. Accurate product cost roll-ups at multiple levels of detail (Component -  Assembly -  Sub-System - Total Product)\n\n**What is the main deliverable of the project?**\n\n> Manufacturability Analysis System (software), to include the following software interfaces: (Manufacturing Analysis Augmentation Tool, PTC Windchill, aPriori, Manufacturability Analysis web application), System Specification (document) that adequately supports full-scale deployment of the MAS at Oshkosh and other industrial organizations",

The proposed tool will interact with users via the IC.IDO virtual reality platform. With minimal input from the user beyond the CAD assembly, the tool will present alternative ways of assembling the components of the represented CAD product. The goal is a demonstratable platform wherein a CAD assembly is used to initiate the process. This is followed by a presentation of the model within IC.IDO and the initiation of a user-interaction to clarify part-to-part constraints. Following this input phase, the assembly planning search process will commence using evaluation criteria previously developed and augmented by the Probability Certificate of Correctness work performed under DARPA AVM META program. Finally, the resulting assembly plans will be presented via IC.IDO, and the user will be able to visualize and interact with the plan.\n\n**What is the industry problem this project address?**\n\n> Early detection of manufacturability issues or expected excessive costs prior to manufacturing release will reduce product cost and total development time\n\n**If successful, what will the project provide or achieve for industry members?**\n\n> They can use the tool to quickly find an optimal assembly plan. They will likely learn new ways of assembling that they had not previously considered. They may find better ways to lay out an assembly facility based on the results. They may find ways to redefine parts to minimize assembly plans. They can use results to adjust current plans based on changes such as delays from OEM subcontractors or assembling different products within the same product family.\n\n**What is the main deliverable of the project?**\n\n> The main deliverable is an add-on module to ESI's IC.IDO virtual reality platform.",

        "projectSummary": "Tolerance specification can be separated into two major tasks; tolerance schema generation and tolerance value specification. For this purpose, the first major step is to identify mating features called assembly features. Also, in order to create the tolerance chains we need Local Constraints (assembly feature relationships), Global constraints (part feature relationships) and directions of control. In addition, we have to identify feature patterns since they have associated tolerances according to Dimensioning and Tolerancing Standard ASME Y14.5M. Directions in which these loops lie are also needed; we call them Direction of Control (DoC). Then we can create the GD&T schema, allocate tolerance values, and prepare it for tolerance evaluation. The verified GD&T specs are translated to STEP AP242 format.\n\n**What is the industry problem this project address?**\n\n> Controlling manufacturing variability through analytical models. Designers must consider proper functioning and assemblability of parts by appropriate tolerance specification, and subsequent assembly stack analyses, to ensure adequate clearance or interference at critical locations. Various interactive computer aided tolerance software (CATS) tools are available today for worst case and statistical tolerance stack analyses. However, these tools do not aid synthesis; they require the user to input a complete and consistent GD&T scheme. The ability for a designer to generate a good tolerance scheme may take years of experience and requires deep knowledge not only of the device function, but also of GD&T standards. This is often accomplished by trial and error. Assemblability is affected by not only tolerance values, but also tolerance types used, choice of datums, dimension control sequence (datum flow chain), and also, by what is NOT controlled\n\n**If successful, what will the project provide or achieve?**\n\n> Automation of first order GD&T for mechanical assemblies. No one has automated tolerance synthesis before.\n\n**What is the main deliverable of the project?**\n\n> Technical Report and Software executables/modules - schema, allocation, translation",
